## Usage
You can view the slide deck here: https://rawgit.com/jthomale/c4l2015-presentation/master/slides.html. Many images have not been optimized at all for Web viewing, so you may need to give it a minute to load all the assets. Alternately, you can clone the repository or download the .zip file and open slides.html in a browser.

Presentation notes are included, which you can toggle on and off with the 'n' key.

Printing the slides as-is will give you ~28 pages, including small versions of slides and notes. Modify print_styles.css if you want to enlarge slides or remove notes.
