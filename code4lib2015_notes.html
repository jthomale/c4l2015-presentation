        <p>but since Summon has been live, usage has equalized, and people have been using both systems in about equal amounts. In hindsight this might not be surprising, but, before we implemented Summon, we were a little curious whether or not Summon would cannibalize catalog use. But even after a couple of years, we see *both* a lot of search activity in Summon *and* people are still searching the catalog. I know this finding might seem kind of trivial, but it suggests that both systems *are* used and *are* necessary, if not that they outright fulfill different needs.</p>
        <p>Next I want to point out two clearly different patterns of use in each system by semester. </p>

        <p>they are in the catalog. When a semester ends, Summon use drops off immediately and remains low until the next semester begins, while catalog use generally remains a little bit steadier during semester breaks. So it appears that Summon use is a bit more tied to the academic calendar than catalog use. Again, it's different patterns of use.</p>

        <p>I want to zero in on Summon.</p>
        <p>I've mentioned that we primarily use Summon as a "find articles" search in our discovery environment. And that search actually limits to the "journal article" content type by default. There are ways around that. People can start a new basic or advanced search that clears all existing options, people can change content type limits via facets, and we have Summon search widgets on various subject pages that may or may not search just articles. </p>
        <p>So, from our stats can we tell if people intentionally use Summon primarily to find articles? Well, let's see. I'm going throw some numbers at you.</p>

In context of all searches this is still a relatively small number, however you have to keep in mind that, since that limit is present on most searches by default, the opportunity to add the limit is a lot rarer than the opportunity to remove it or add other content type limits.
